1.
Program takes in a text file, creates a flat map of each line in the file, then makes a map of all the characters in those lines, reduces by key to consolidate the character frequency count, and sorts that frequency list in order.
We then find the number of steps in the alphabet between this character and the most common letter in the English language (starting with 'e', then testing other letters if not a match).
Every letter in the encrypted text is shifted accordingly (numbers and special characters are left alone).
The shifted text is printed out.
If at least 75% of the words are valid English words, then it is decrypted accurately


2) The results for question 2 is in the screenshots

2.2  Only the alpabetic characters are altered.
The dictionary in the program checks the implementation and removes special characters before checking if a word is a valid English word, improving its accuracy.
Note: all words are immediately converted to lowercase early in the program, and remain lowercase throughout, including when saved to a decrypted text file.
Note: while indents and large spacing remain in the decrypted file, everything is consolidated down to one line
